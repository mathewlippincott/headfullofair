Where I&#8217;ve been the last six weeks is cartridge land.  Lots of production problems.  For the hub I had to switch from lathe/cnc to stereolithography, and the polystyrene (generic .015&#8243; plasticard) had processing problems that the printer had to work out (beautiful now).  Mounting the cards into the hub took several tries as well&#8230; **[Big gallery here][1]**, a gallery where I&#8217;ll be collecting a lot more work soon (2008 WSCCPR videos will be back up Real Soon Now).

The next step is to attach the finished[ **projector**][3] to the player with speedrail.
