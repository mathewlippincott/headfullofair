This blog has been falling behind, I&#8217;m just going to summarize what I&#8217;ve been up to.

The[ Cloacina Project][1] is going great.  Our work is [on display in LA right now,][2] and I&#8217;ve been playing a lot with cell phones.

I&#8217;ve been writing.  Back in December I said I wanted to write another chapter to my balloon-making guide.  Well, it&#8217;s been raining.  So I wrote about space dreams instead, Molly illustrated it.  &#8220;Autonomy and a New High Tech&#8221; its in [Hack this Zine #9][3]

I&#8217;m showing some work (at Grand Detour) and working on some new art, and spending a lot of time at [Grand Detour ][4]& [Research Club][5]. Both super excellent.
