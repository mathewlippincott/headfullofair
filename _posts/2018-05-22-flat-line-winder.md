This kite line winder is designed for a figure eight winding technique. Winding line in a figure eight ∞ folds the line so that there is no twist. 
Line can also be thrown off the winder rapidly:

The winder is 450mm (18") long and can hold about 500' of 150lb dacron line (150m of 70kg line).

Here's a quick flight, letting line out and winding in:

# how to make the winder

![winder2-sm.svg](/assets/images/flat-winder/winder2-sm.svg)

Go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/mathewlippincott/flat-winder/) and download the SVG or DXF file in the root directory of the repository. All design files are in mm and were made with [QCAD](https://qcad.org/). 

Cut from 1/2" (12mm) plywood or similar material. Drill out the pink drill holes with a 1" (25mm) hole saw or drill bit, and finish the cuts with hand or power tools. Or use a CNC mill.

The design can be converted to convenient inch measurements by assuming 1" = 25mm.

# about this design

This design was inspired by sport kite winders and the [G-Kites](https://www.gkites.com/store/) Wooden Line Winder. Winder features I want:

* One person can both wind line and fly the kite.
* Line can be given to the kite smoothly.
* Line twisting is minimized or eliminated.
* Fits in a 5" (130mm) cardboard tube with a kite.
* Has no moving parts.
* Can be made with basic tools.
* Material efficient and easy to make in batches.

# things to change

Consider moving the handles. Their current placement was chosen for rigidity, as cutting out a middle handle can lead to warping. 

![Winder with a handle in the middle, looking very nice before it warped](/assets/images/flat-winder/middle-handle-winder.jpg)

The side handles are convenient for letting line out, and the middle handle is a bit easier when winding line in. I don't know which has better ergonomics overall.
