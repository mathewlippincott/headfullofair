With the pandemic in full swing, helium is rather expensive and has been difficult to get. I've therefore been keeping track of suppliers and their offerings on a map.

If you find a helium supplier that is not on my [Helium Map](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/helium-suppliers_259236#4/40.88/-81.62) (embedded below), please add one to [the Github repository](https://github.com/mathewlippincott/helium-map) or [contact me](/contact) with the info.

This map is built using [uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/), a free and open source tool built on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84). I'm rather fond of it. It allows you to pick a tile layer and even customize the look of the arrows, as I did on this [service map](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/futel-service-map_551231#4/42.46/-101.41) for [Futel](https://futel.net/). In addition to the web management interface, all the entries can be stored in and updated by from a CSV file, allowing version control.
