**[I just started building fled kite][1]s**, but my fellow Grassroots Mapper Nathan Craig is **[already doing 3D topographic scans with them.][2] ** He&#8217;s using **[AgiSoft&#8217;s PhotoScan][3]**, which is unfortunately not open source, and costs $179.  But as he points out, you** [just feed it images and it makes a damned good 3D model.][4]**
