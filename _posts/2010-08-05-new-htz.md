There&#8217;s a new Hack This Zine out!  **[Check out 10.5][1]**, where there&#8217;s a great dialogue about the coming Robocracy.  hilarious, and telling.  Flatline points out that in the past it was thought that robots would replace manual labor, but it&#8217;s turned out that they&#8217;re becoming middle-low level management, and replacing clerical workers.  It&#8217;s time to revive the Yippie employment platform: Mandatory unemployment! Make the machines do it!
