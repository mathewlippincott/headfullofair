Two organizations in Portland that I love! WOah, and [I&#8217;m in the video](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/127455621/heavy-meta-tour-connecting-international-artists-a).  one thing- it says my balloons are in the gulf taking pictures.  My balloons aren&#8217;t in the gulf, just [my folding guides and plastics research][1].  The balloons are collaborative.  Most of the gulf folks are using [**Southern Balloon Works**][2] balloons,[** but we have good diy kits too**.][3]

**[Research Club][4]** || [**Grand Detour**][5]
