I&#8217;m not up on my balloon news! posted here for the purpose of completeness. **[ California Near Space][1]**  was **[already slashdotted][2]** four days ago.

Amazing, they beat the **[White Star][3]** team and **[Robert Rochte][4]**, who **[threwdown][5]** on transatlantic ballooning earlier in the year with his SDG-10, which **[appears to still be grounded.][4]**

White Star&#8217;s not working with off the shelf balloons though&#8211; they&#8217;ve got a bigger goal: **[DIY  tropospheric superpressure balloons][6]**.  these will be capable of multi-week flights, if successfully built.  Dan Bowen&#8217;s talk&#8211; Jump to 3:30 into this talk, and see the superpressure tetroon discussion.  5:40, discussion of Rochte&#8217;s designs.
