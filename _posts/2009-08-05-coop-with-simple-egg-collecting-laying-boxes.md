Molly and I made a chicken coop last week with laying boxes designed after those on her father&#8217;s farm.  As far as we can tell, they&#8217;re a Gunnar Danielsson original design.  The laying box depends on chickens&#8217; instinctual egg rotation.   Every time a chicken stands up off of an egg, it kicks the egg a little, rotating it.  In Gunnar&#8217;s boxes the floor is sloped just enough so an egg starts rolling when the chicken kicks it, and ends up underneath a hinged drawer.

**[Molly][2]** drew out the design and I did tests and built it while she was out of town.  It&#8217;s 70&#8243; long, accommodating five 14&#8243; laying boxes for large Buff Orphingtons.  Five laying boxes should be enough for 20 hens total.  First I determined a proper angle of between 10-12 degrees for the floor, then built the box.  The laying boxes are still missing curtains, but Katie will sew them up.  We built it all into a coop that will have a deep mulch floor, per plans in the [**Integral Urban House Book**][3].  Soon the coop will have swinging perches too.
