I want [Airpup](tags/airpup) to be fun and social, and worked with [Justin Nichol](https://www.patreon.com/justinnichol) to create a character that not only represents Airpup, but could be drawn directly on the balloon.

Because there are no animals that fly by buoyancy, balloons' closest animal analogs are sea creatures. As a small balloon Airpup needs a high volume shape. So does the Nerpa, a tiny seal with a thick layer of blubber living in frigid Lake Baikal.

Starting from the Nerpa as inspiration for a friendly sky seal, Justin created Airpup in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), the open source digital painting tool.

Working from a [3D model of Airpup](https://github.com/mathewlippincott/airpup-balloon) Justin created a simplified view of Airpup's face that would be visible from a long distance. Using the vinyl cutter at [Ctrl-H](http://pdxhackerspace.org/) I cut out a stick-on face for Airpup:
