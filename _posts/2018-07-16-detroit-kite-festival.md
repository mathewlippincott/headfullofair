I went to the [Detroit Kite Festival](https://detroitkitefestival.org/) with Colleen Donaldson and we had a blast! The organizers pulled off a wonderful and inclusive festival complete with a huge stack of kites to borrow, A kite book library, free kid-oriented kite making out of paper, free kites from sponsors, and my favorite part, a free kitemaking booth called "Will It Fly?" with stacks of reused materials for kite making.

We caught a Wind Jammers performance while the Detroit Philharmonic played, and I ran into Dave Bydlowski from the [AREN Project](https://www.globe.gov/web/aren-project). Colleen and Dave made it into the Detroit Free Press. 

The gallery below has some notes. I also took some [aerial photos](/post/detroit-kite-festival-aerial-photos).
