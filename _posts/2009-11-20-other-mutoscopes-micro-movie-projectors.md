Two other people making mutoscopes:

**[The Process Enacted Mutoscope][1]** uses over 900 Polaroids, and is **[finished elegantly][2]**, but runs in spits.  One immediate refinement I&#8217;d suggest is to change the gearing.  It looks like it&#8217;s geared 1:1 or 2:1. I bet if they geared down the crank 20:1 or more the flipping of the cards would be much smoother. A worm drive is nearly ubiquitous amongst **[classic mutoscopes][3]**.  
**[Sergey Gavrilenko][4]**, Director of the **[Museum of the History of the Development of the World Cinemagraphic Technology][5]** in Kiev, Ukraine, contacted me about his **[superb mutoscope][6]**, a historical reproduction similar to this one in the **[Eastman Collection][7]**.  More impressive than his mutoscope are his** [functioning miniature film projectors][6]**.   I wish there was a video of them running.  Movies on microfilm are another Atomic Age sci-fi dream dashed by magnetic storage.

Look for miniature projectors starting at 1:57 in this video
