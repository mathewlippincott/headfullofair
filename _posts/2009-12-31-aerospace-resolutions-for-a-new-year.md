I know I&#8217;ve been talking a lot about mutoscopes (that thing took all my time), but I really will get back to balloons.  Here&#8217;s a shot of a new design I&#8217;m working on for short hops, it&#8217;s had two flights with two different riggings since september.  it&#8217;s a tetrahedron flying upside down.  I&#8217;m going to try to illustrate a second chapter to my **[balloon building guide][2]** in January, focusing on the short hop balloon.  There won&#8217;t be many flights though, because I&#8217;m moving to **[Portland][3]**.  That will be my last design for low flight and line control- next year I&#8217;ll be putting my ham license to good use on some higher altitude stuff.

Don&#8217;t hold me to it, but I want to get into automated flight control of solar hot air, with temp and light sensors inside a balloon and a controlled valve.

The rest of the time I&#8217;ll be composting, looking for a job in waste management, and trying to start a small business.  More on all that later, but the short of it is I want to work towards creating new blue collar jobs that manage enclosed resource cycles- i.e. engineering is great, but you&#8217;ll still need a plumber in space.
