Its been so long since an update.  I Spent my summer between **[Switzerland][1]**, studying sanitation with **[Cewas][2] **and **[Butte, Montana][3]** working on community mapping in Centerville through **[Public Laboratory][4]** and the **[Scoria Residency Program][5].**  Now **[Molly and I][6]** are mentoring a studio at**[ PNCA&#8217;s MFA program in Collaborative Design][7]**, and I&#8217;m teaching a class on an intermedia undergraduate course in Art and Science.  First critique is tomorrow&#8230;

In the mean time, I&#8217;m making a** [cheap kite kit from bamboo and tyvek][9]**.
