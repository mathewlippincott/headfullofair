**[Nomadic Furniture][1]** is a brilliant book series, and now you can get 1 & 2 for the cost of one of the used first edition books. Hopefully the re-print will be as good as the original.Â  I also recommend Victor Papanek and James Hennesey&#8217;s other book together, the amazing and hard-to-find **[How Things Don&#8217;t Work][2]**.
