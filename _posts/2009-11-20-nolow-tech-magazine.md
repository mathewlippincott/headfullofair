Kris de Decker produces some of the **[most insightful][1]** and **[well-researched articles][2]** on technology anywhere on the internet.  He has a simple premise- novel &#8220;high-tech&#8221; solutions aren&#8217;t always that great.  Don&#8217;t give up on established, simple, and efficient solutions to human problems.  He just **[linked back to me][3]** when I pointed him to KMODDL, and I wanted to share some stuff he&#8217;s posted, since it&#8217;s been sitting in my &#8220;to post&#8221; folder since August:

Kris often finds works from another age whose techno boosterism is familiar, but whose object is odd to a contemporary reader. From the height of airship mania ( Zeppelin&#8217;s commercial air transport service was established a year later) and before airplanes proved themselves in the skies, **[Airships Past and Present (1908)][4]** is a fantastic snapshot of globalized tinkering and ingenious innovations:

In 1792, Uyton de Morveau recieved official instructions from Napoleon to develop military balloons.  Morveau developed a team with chemist Lovoisier and physicist Coutelle,  and together they developed a novel hydrogen generator that used a hot iron with steam passing over it, and a novel means of sealing silk balloons with 5 layers of linseed oil based varnish.  The varnish was particularly effective, holding hydrogen in the balloon for upwards of 2 months, but the recipe is lost to history.  The envelope of a hydrogen balloon capable of carrying 2 passengers to 1600ft  would weigh only 180-200lbs, in line with early 20th century numbers (134).

OR:

My favorite balloon of the period, the Parseval-Sigfeld, featured with hard numbers on wind speed (66ft per second).  Parseval invented the &#8220;sausage&#8221; balloon design that once refined was deployed by Germany, France, and to great effect Belgium in WWI.  But this text is of course from before the war (209, 211, 274).
