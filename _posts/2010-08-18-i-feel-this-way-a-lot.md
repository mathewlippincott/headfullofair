&#8220;When sophistication loses content then the only way of keeping in touch with reality is to be crude and superficial.  This is what I intend to be.&#8221;  
Paul Feyerabend  
page 158 &#8220;How to Defend Society Against Science&#8221;, *Scientific Revolutions,* Oxford Readings in Philosophy

Feyerabend&#8217;s critiques the application of scientific theory to social prescriptions.  But this quotation struck me because it could be re-applied to the contemporary art world so easily.  Sophistication without content.  It is, however, fascinating how crude and superficial attacks on content-less sophistication have been subsumed into a sophisticated discourse.

oh man, venomous attacks against a vague subject like the &#8220;art world.&#8221;  I must be tired. oh well, POST!
