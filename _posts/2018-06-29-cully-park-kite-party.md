Join a kitemaking and flying party at the [Grand Opening of Cully Park](http://www.livingcully.org/event/cully-park-grand-opening/) in Portland, OR on June 30th, from noon-4pm. 

We'll be making a 2' version of Stormy's Sled. Some old notes on the design in [this post](/post/stormy-o-weathers-horned-allison-towards-a-kite-wind-speed-meter/). I also made some of these at [Boundary Layers](/post/boundary-layers-eclipse/). I'll have full kite plans posted soon.
