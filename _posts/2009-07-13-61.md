Several amateurs played in aerospace around Toorcamp, and many more space lovers and hobbiests were present. JonM from Hackerbot, who is one of the leads on the **[AHAB (Another High Altitude Balloon)][1]** project gave me my ham radio cram course and test. You can see him in a hat in **[this photo][2]**, taken by Bre Pettis&#8217;s kite aerial photography rig. Bre, Adam, and Zach of **[Makerbot Industries][3]** tried a few times to get that beautiful ram-air kite up, too bad I wasn&#8217;t there to see it snapping away.

Eric of Hackerbot also **[had a few kites ][4]**of his own that he let us play with. As for myself, I lost my tiny solar hot air balloon on it&#8217;s first run- it gets WAY more lift in dry air than in muggy Brooklyn- the spool just lept out of my hands.

Still, I did my best to plug solar balloons, especially the Yahoo Solar Balloons Group and **[Robert Rochte and his class at Gross Pointe Academy][5]** doing long distance solar-heated missions.  
Then of course there were the dust storms which brought a pair of flying pants, several airborne tents, and at least one dome.
