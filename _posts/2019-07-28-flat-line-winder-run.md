I did a production run of 30 flat winders based on [my design from last spring](http://www.headfullofair.com/tags/flat-winder/), and also illustrated some instructions.

The winders were cut on a CNC mill with a 1/8" bevel on both sides.

## instructions
I turned these instructions into a tag that can be tied to the winder (as shown in the header image, above).
