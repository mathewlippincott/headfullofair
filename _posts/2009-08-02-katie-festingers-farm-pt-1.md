Molly and I have been working/staying at Katie Festinger&#8217;s nascent farm in Chimacum, WA (near Port Townsend) on and off for the last 3 weeks.  Katie sought workers with carpentry experience through **[Washington Tilth ][1]** who shared an interest in Christopher Alexander&#8217;s Pattern Language building and analysis methods, and found us.

We&#8217;ve had a great time living and working there.  Katie, Beth and Dan are all wonderful and caring people to be and work with, and the area is gorgeous.  We really connected personally, and I hope we&#8217;ve made long time friends.  Molly described the area as &#8220;exactly like Sweden only more stuff grows and it actually gets warm.&#8221; I hope we get to go back some day.
