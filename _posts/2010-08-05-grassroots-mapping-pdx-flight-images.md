I still haven&#8217;t stitched together a map from my helium flight on 7/9, but here are some great aerial photos:

From the solar balloon flights.  I really wish I could send these balloons above 150ft, as is **[RJ][1]** and I we only got shots of the beach.

/* rant

this is a great shot of me and robby kraft inflating a solar balloon on 7/27, taken by Samantha Mitchell.  We never got into the Sauve Island airspace though, the Sheriff told us to stop.  He was jovial, but wouldn&#8217;t give us a charge or cite what statute we were violating.  I actually had to chase him down and harangue him before he conceeded that he&#8217;d ticket us for &#8220;harassing wildlife.&#8221; The only wildlife we harassed was the pig tooling around in a pickup truck.  We had the decency to walk into the refuge on foot.

**Helium Flight**

I&#8217;ve got over 800 photos that need stitching from this one, my dad and I went to a little over 1000 ft on the beach at Seaside, OR.
