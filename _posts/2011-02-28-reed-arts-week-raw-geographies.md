I&#8217;m proud to be participating in Reed&#8217;s Art Week. I&#8217;ll be giving** a[ lecture and demonstration ][1]**of aerospace in the arts and Grassroots Mapping tools on Saturday, March 5 @ Noon. <del>Location is still TBA</del>. At the Gray Campus Center room C. There will be**[ complementary supplies and instructions for building your own solar hot air balloon.  
][2]**

Essentially this kit, minus the expensive stuff (wind speed meter, infrared thermometer).

**Come for balloons, stay for Francis Alÿs**

At 4pm Saturday there will be a showing of Francis Alÿs&#8217;s *When Faith Moves Mountains, *and other works.  Of course, you could watch his work on your computer, but get out and enjoy the cinema!
