Thanks to Karly Placek, John Murphy, and the [Litton Entertainment](https://www.litton.tv/) team for making a film shoot work in the midst of the pandemic and for flying me to California so we could have better weather. Also thanks to [Albert Lawrence](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4184546/), who picked out the perfect orange outfit to go with Aipup.
