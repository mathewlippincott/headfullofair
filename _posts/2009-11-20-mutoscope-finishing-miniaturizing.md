Between coats of paint and sealer, waiting for the last epoxy bonds to take hold, and tweaking the Mutoscope&#8217;s tripod I&#8217;ve played around with small mutoscope reels.  Last year I tried making one out of paper with a craft knife, but the accuracy of a knife and flimsiness of paper got the better of me.

Now, with the help of Matt, and Raphael, and especially Kelly at **[NYC Resistor][3]**&#8216;s craft night I cut a 500-card capacity hub based on the original dimensions of the **[Kinora.][4]** Wonderfully meta: the Kinora hub is laser cut out of spare Mutoscope cards.  A miniature mutoscope manufactured from a super-sized one.  If I can dig up the material and machine time I&#8217;ll cut enough cards to fill it.  ** [Or you could make your own (here&#8217;s the .ai file).][5]**
