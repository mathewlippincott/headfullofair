I've relaunched this blog in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), rather than Wordpress. Iâ€™ve got some fun flying stuff in the works too.

This blog has been quiet for 5 years! Posting my flight [projects on publiclab.org](publiclab.org/profile/mathew) left this site neglected. I also have had work sprawled across various projects and social media 

* [Recode](Recodenow.org)
* [MDML](mdml.co)
* [Cloacina](cloacina.org)
* [instagram](instagram.com/headfullofair)
* [twitter](twitter.com/headfullofair) 

Over the coming months I'll be pulling most of those projects together on this site, and moving away from social-media-first posting.  I miss blogging.
