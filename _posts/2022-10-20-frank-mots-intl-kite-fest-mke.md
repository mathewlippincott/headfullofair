At the 2022 [Frank Mots International Kite Festival](https://city.milwaukee.gov/County-Events/Frank-Mots-International-Kite-Festival-at-Veterans-Park) in Milwaukee, We flew kites and [kite banners](/post/tulle-kite-banners/), and also captured aerial photos (this post) and [ground shots](/post/frank-mots-intl-kite-fest-gallery/). I flew my DJI  Pocket 2, mounted to a [3D printed picavet rig](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:281677) from the [KAPtery](http://kaptery.com/), and lifted by my (now discontinued) Into the Wind [Levitation](https://intothewind.com/Item--i-3610) Light. Colleen Donaldson controlled the camera from an iPhone on the ground while I maneuvered the kite. 

We were out at the point in veterans park, which became the major public flying field during the festival.

We spotted a wide variety of excellent commercial and homemade kites. We also flew two text banners, and this was the first time they've been captured from kites. 
The silver kite seen on the ground is by [Hai-Wen Lin](https://www.haiwenlin.com/about). This kite's hand-dyed tails look great in these photos.
