A good chunk of <span><span>Toorcamp</span></span> <span>occurred</span> in a Titan 1 missile silo amongst a complex of hemispherical blast domes.  The power dome is the largest and least obstructed of these, and the open space obliterated sound into crackling and unfocused echos. [<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-69" title="Titan 1 Blast Dome, Toorcamp 2009" src="http://www.headfullofair.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/p1040957-300x168.jpg" alt="p1040957" width="300" height="168" />][1]  
Standing in the dome I drifted back to my obsession of the last two months- the R & D of an updated **[<span><span>mutoscope</span></span>][2]** standard.  I&#8217;m using hemispherical reflectors in <span><span>mutoscope&#8217;s</span></span> opaque projector, and although my intuition lead me toward this shape, I didn&#8217;t really understand how it worked until standing in the blast dome, trying to make out a human voice.  
Classically,[ **<span><span>mutoscopes</span></span> use peep viewers**][2], but I thought that a thoroughly modern <span><span>mutoscope</span></span> would project either internally or externally to an appropriate home viewing size of about 20&#8243; diagonal.   But **[opaque projectors][3]** are extremely inefficient.  I can only assume that inefficiency, heat stress, and poor image quality doomed **[William <span><span>Rabkin&#8217;s</span></span>][4]** patented 1933 (#2,070,840) <span><span>mutoscope</span></span>.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-70" title="Side view of Rabkin's projection Mutoscope, patent #02070840, 1933" src="http://www.headfullofair.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/01_02070840_exp-300x230.png" alt="Side view of Rabkin's projection Mutoscope, patent #02070840, 1933" width="300" height="230" />][5]

Most commercial designs consist of a single <span>light bulb</span> in a reflective box.  The projected image is riven with glare in cheap models and <span>vignetting</span> in even the best projectors.   I figured I could do better.  
In an attempt to out-do existing projectors, I decided to directly illuminate the projected page with spot lights.  But no matter what the configuration of the lights I couldn&#8217;t throw an even light across the projected image, and I got even more nasty hot spots and glare than commercial projectors.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-71" title="My original idea, it didn't work out" src="http://www.headfullofair.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/p1040354c-300x269.jpg" alt="My original idea, it didn't work out" width="300" height="269" />][6]  
But walking down Union st in Brooklyn one Sunday, I noticed a standard clamp light with a diffusion powder coat on the inside of it&#8217;s hemispherical reflector.  The <span><span>radious</span></span> of the hemisphere is 5&#8243; in diameter, not far off the focal distance of my 125mm lens.  By facing my lens at the top of the hemisphere and facing my lights inwards such that their filaments are level with the picture plane,  I created a perfect band of light across the image.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-72" title="The prototype setup, lights flush with the image plane" src="http://www.headfullofair.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/p1040569_sm-168x300.jpg" alt="p1040569_sm" width="168" height="300" />][7]  
<span>I erroneously thought that I was bouncing the light across the interior of the sphere, but standing in the blast dome listening to people talk I realized that a sound generated within the hemisphere reflects along the curve of the dome, dispersing off imperfections at every point it touches.  My powder-coated reflector is doing the same thing with light.   I&#8217;m not sure of the math, but there is an inverse relation between the the source to edge distance and the number of reflections. </span>
