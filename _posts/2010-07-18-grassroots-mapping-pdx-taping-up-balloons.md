I&#8217;ve finally collected and edited the workshop&#8217;s videos and instructions:

**Taping Instructions  
**

Follow the first two pages of my **[Balloon Building Guide][1]** to make a tetrahedron balloon.  Tape carefully.

My balloon guide&#8217;s rigging is for short flights in confined urban areas.  We&#8217;re going to use a different rigging for aerial photography.

One corner of the balloon is used for filling, and is tied off, like a trash bag.  A second corner is re-enforced, and a loop of tape attached.  To the tape is tied a short length of line.  The knot used is a** [Bowline][6]**.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-326" title="attach a swivel to the balloon" src="https://www.headfullofair.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/20100715.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="389" />][10]

attach a swivel to the balloon so that any spinning won&#8217;t twist the line or the camera.
