Helium can lift approximately 65lb. per 1000 cubic ft. from the images in the video, the balloon was no more than 12ft in diameter, or approximately 900 cubic feet. The boy, the balloon, and all the equipment can&#8217;t weigh less than 65lbs. Next time you want to wast millions of public money, do the math first.
