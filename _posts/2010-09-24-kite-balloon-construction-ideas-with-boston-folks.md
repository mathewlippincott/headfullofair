Sketch of an elliptical kite balloon like the [**Allsopp Helikite**][2] constructed with a rolling heat sealer (on left).

Jeffrey Warren and I discussed these kite balloon designs when I was at his studio.  [**Southern Balloon Works**][3], where a lot of spherical Grassroots Mapping balloons come from, makes a similar kite balloon with a [**drag rather than lift structure for stability**][4]. John Borden of [**Peace River Sudios**][5] loaned me the roller sealer.
