Overall I loved the **[Seattle Public Library Central Branch][1]**, but some design consultant somewhere has a bad attitude towards the public- several spaces scream &#8220;you are not a citizen, and this isn&#8217;t yours.&#8221;

Beautiful outdoor courtyards perfect for sitting  are deliberately ruined by no place to sit, forcing people to squat on a tiny ½&#8221; steel bar, or to climb the lattice work.

At the Seattle Public Library  the stalls end below 5 feet.  Plenty of public libraries have homeless people smoking crack in the bathrooms, including my dear **[SIBL][4]**.  But that&#8217;s just part of the ambiance.  Get over it.  I did not need to make eye contact with a security guard during my bowel movement.
