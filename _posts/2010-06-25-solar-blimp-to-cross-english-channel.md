While I&#8217;m preparing for a workshop where we&#8217;ll build some solar hot-air balloons, a **[very different solar aerostat][1]**, running of photovoltaics, is set to cross the English Channel!Â  As thin-film solar cells improve and energy prices, rise, I bet these things will be a really big deal.
