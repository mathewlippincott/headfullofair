My current [kite aerial photography rigs](/tags/rigs) and a [flat winder](/tags/flat-winder) of string, fits in a small shoulder bag and weighs a little over 2 pounds. My rig's portability let me do a quick flight at the new Komatsu headquarters, across from the school of Freshwater Sciences on Milwaukee Harbor.
