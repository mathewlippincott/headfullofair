I achieved my primary goal of getting a ham radio license, and I met all sorts of amazing people. If only one of them gets back to me I&#8217;ll be elated (already happened). But right now I need to go back to sleeping. **[No more doing awesomely nerdy stuff all day, drinking till 4AM, waking up with the sun, and running from dust storms][1]**. Also, WTF is up with my blog- all the posts are suddenly appearing in bold- I&#8217;ll have to handle that later.
