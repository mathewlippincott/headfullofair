Met and ran into fellow grassroots mapping folks Bonny Gregory and [**Cesar Harada**][1], and my old roommate [**Isaac Ravishankara**][2].

[**Bruce Perens**][3]** & **[**John Wilbanks**][4] echoed each other:

&#8220;IP is a disease, good open licensing and prior art databases can innoculate the future against it.

**[John Wilbanks][4]**

freedom doesn&#8217;t come from the barrel of a license.  decide on the values underlying the license.

**Nina Paley:**

&#8220;Copyright is like kids, you don&#8217;t own &#8216;em.&#8221;

**Business Forum**

Successful Open hardware projects are awesome but their businesses are boring- 40% markup, good relationship with shipping, quality, trademark protection, insurance, accounting.

Had a great talk with [**Britta Riley**][5], [**Jeffrey Lipton**][6], and [**Chris from Netduino**][7] about licensing mechanical and analog devices.  I&#8217;ve been thinking of  a way to frame the problem, and I think I&#8217;ve got a helpful case-study, [**the miter box**:][8]

Designed to replicate exact and consistant angles, a new miter box can be cut using an existing miter box as a guide.  It is also a simple enough object that whenever it&#8217;s used, it&#8217;s ability to copy itself is implied.  Instructions can be written, but they really aren&#8217;t necessary.  I think it can be said that the miter box  contains it&#8217;s own instructions.

I don&#8217;t know what our open licenses should look like, but I think they aught to account for objects like a miter box.

Talked to [**Chris Anderson**][9] about flying safety and PET film.  In Grassroots Mapping we&#8217;ve been discussing making to PET  balloons, and we&#8217;re trying to decide between aluminized (less helium loss) and uncoated PET for balloons. Chris&#8217;s company [**DIY Drones sells a mylar UAV blimp kit**][10].   Chris&#8217;s advice: go with uncoated PET, aluminized balloons can short out power lines if they break free.
