web activist aaron swartz&#8217;s blog uses two columns that are left and right aligned. in a large browser window they open a gaping hole in the middle of the page.

When I browsed to his site my first instinct was to shrink my window down to about 700 pixels wide. at it&#8217;s minimum size, I believe (but can&#8217;t verify) that the site is exactly a sideways fullscreen iphone.
