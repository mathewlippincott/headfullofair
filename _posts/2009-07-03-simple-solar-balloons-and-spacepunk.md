After my ignite talk I met **[Alex Peake,][1]** who is trying to fund efforts in human potential and space exploration through the sales of a **[Tactical Corset][2]** (it looks pretty good and flexible, for a bullet-proof vest). His talk was on &#8220;Spacepunk&#8221; and obviously we hit it off. Since I was talking up **[my simple solar balloon][3]**, here&#8217;s a video I just took in Mount Prospect Park. I love how the little balloon can be walked, using the line as ballast. It reminds me of a diatom the way it floats without care for gravity. Other balloons may go higher, but this is a nice, pocket-sized and weightless pet. **<a><br /> </a>**
