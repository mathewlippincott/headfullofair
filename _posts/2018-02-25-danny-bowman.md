[Danny Bowman](https://bovineaerospace.wordpress.com) has just published on the array of 20' solar hot air balloons [he and Sarah Albert flew with a network of infrasound sensors](https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gji/ggy069/4898033). On his blog you can find [instructions for the 20' balloons](https://bovineaerospace.wordpress.com/2016/06/08/how-to-build-a-high-altitude-solar-balloon/), which are made from HDPE painters' drop cloth and packing tape, and darkened with charcoal.

Danny and company are currently preparing a massive 40' balloon at the [Albuquerque International Balloon Museum](https://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/balloonmuseum), and he's posted some videos of the assembly currently underway on [his Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannycbowman):

I can't wait to see what the future holds!

Fly all day, land at sunset.  Got a payload?
