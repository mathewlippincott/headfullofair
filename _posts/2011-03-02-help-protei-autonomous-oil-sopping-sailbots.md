[Protei](http://v2.nl/archive/works/protei) is a project I whole heartedly support. Cesar Harada has put together an incredible team, and with a little money it is going to happen.

> &#8220;We are developing Protei : a low-cost open-source oil collecting robot that autonomously sails upwind, intercepting oil sheens going downwind. Protei combines conventional technologies in an innovative design that we can implement in the short term to address timely environmental crisis.&#8221;
