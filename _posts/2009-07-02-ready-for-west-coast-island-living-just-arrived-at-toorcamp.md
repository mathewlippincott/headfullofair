So **[Molly][1] **and I packed up all our stuff and moved out of New York, at least for the summer. We&#8217;ll be on the San Juan Islands, trying to learn about green houses. They&#8217;re a great place to not own a car. I gotta come back to New York to finish the **[mutoscope][2] **in September (been too busy to post, but I&#8217;ve got lots to show), but in the mean time, I&#8217;ll be here in Washington. Right now I&#8217;m at **[ToorCamp][3]**, preparing to give an **[ignite talk][4] **on kite balloons tomorrow.
