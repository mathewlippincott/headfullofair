Most **[home-built airships][1]** are **[non-rigid][2]** using envelope pressure to maintain their shape.  That&#8217;s because** [rigid airships][2]** normally have to be huge to support their gigantic frame.  Rigidity improves maneuverabilty and allows increased speed.  JP Aerospace has just designed **[1.7 PSI thin-film airbeams][3] **light enough to construct into a small airship.  This bodes really well for autonomous and manned small airships.  Oh, if you don&#8217;t know JP Aerospace, they&#8217;re planning to **[float in to space][4]**.
