over at **[AirshipWorld][1]**, Andreas has created a new version of his **[airship profile simulator][2]**.  It&#8217;s only good for rotationally symetrical pressurized envelopes (sorry **[hybrid][3] [lifting body][4] [airship][5] [aficionados][6]**) but it&#8217;s still damned cool! (Windows Only)  Now you can check the drag, volume, surface area, and lift center of your theoretical airship automatically.
