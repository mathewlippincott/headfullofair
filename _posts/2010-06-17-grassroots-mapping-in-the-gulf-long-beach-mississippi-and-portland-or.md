I threw up a quick link to [Grassroots Mapping][1] a[ few weeks ago][2], and in the mean time they&#8217;re on it!  Check out their latest stitch of Long Beach,

Mississippi:

All this **[with party balloons!][5]**

**Grassroots Mapping in Portland:**

**Build Balloons to Map the Gulf!**

I&#8217;ve been in touch with Jeffrey Warren of Grassroots Mapping about inexpensive balloon designs.  They&#8217;ve been playing with trash bags, but were intrigued by tetrahedron balloons and my folding guide.  So here in Portland, OR, I&#8217;m going to lead a workshop to build out some tetrahedron balloons for helium and for solar hot air.  We&#8217;ll fly the balloons to test them out and then send the equipment down to Grassroots Mapping in the Gulf.

I&#8217;ll be one of the speakers at** [Research Club][6]** this weekend, Saturday the 19th (11AM-2PM free brunch) about Grassroots Mapping.  Come join me there, or on Saturday, June 26th to build balloons! (Location TBD).
