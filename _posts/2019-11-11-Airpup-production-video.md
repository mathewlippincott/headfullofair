After a variety of delays, detailed in my previous [studio update videos](/tags/studio-update/), I've finally finished the production prototype of [Airpup](/tags/airpup) and have done a solid test flight. 

My studio update:

My flight was rather gusty and it was hard to keep Airpup in the frame, so this video is a bit fragmented. I explain a bit more about the conditions in my studio update, but overall I was very pleased with Airpup's performance.

The glistening threads are [ballooning spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_(spider)) whose migration was cut short by my kite line. My sincerest apologies to these awesome arachnids.
