While [at the Detroit Kite Festival](/post/detroit-kite-festival/) I captured some aerial photos with my Canon S100 running [CHDK](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK), installed with [STICK](http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/stick/stick.html). It flew on the always-reliable [KAPtery Aerobee rig](http://kaptery.com/product/aerobee-rig-kit), lifted by my Into the Wind [Levitation Light](https://intothewind.com/Item--i-3610).

I had a fairly brief flight window right before the close of the festival, but was still able to capture some great kites in flight.
