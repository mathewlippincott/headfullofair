Fernando Renes&#8217; animation finally came back from the printer&#8217;s last weekend, and Molly helped me bind it into a mutoscope reel.  since my last post everything has been re-built except the projector (I&#8217;m re-building the projector today to cut down on light leaks and get better contrast).  The machine is not quite done, but I felt a wave of success on Thursday night, showing it to Fernando, and then Josiah and Taiwon. Taiwon says, &#8220;its like how TV works, I like it.&#8221; Kids are the best critics.
