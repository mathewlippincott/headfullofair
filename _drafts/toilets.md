Between 2009 and 2014, Molly Danielsson and I ran a design consultancy, MDML, that initiated a sanitation program to create a composting portable toilet business. We called it Cloacina, after the Roman godess of the sewers. 
While regulatory barriers kept the portable toilet business from getting off the ground, our regulatory efforts cleared a path for Oregon's first composting portable toilet companies, revised the emergency sanitation protocols fo the City of Portland, and ultimately led to changing national regulations regarding composting and urine diverting toilets. 

A timeline of significant outcomes with links to further information:

1. Self published a series of six posters on waste and sanitation that were displayed with a CDC show at Emory University.
2. Working with Recode Oregon, added composting toilets to the 2011 Reach Code.
3. Initiated a "Shit Crit" group to enhance DIY composting toilets in the Portland area.
3. Compiled our findings on the operations aspects of composting portable toilets into two self-published booklets:
4. Explored business development through the CEWAS water and sanitation program. 
5. . Replicated the New Alchemy Institute Composting Greenhouse, monitored by a novel cell-modem-based temperature monitoring system, with data retained and displyed by SensorHub, a custom-built software system built in collaboration with R.J. Steinert.
3. Collaborating with PHLUSH, PNCA, and PBEM, created the twin-bucket emergency toilet system and training materials for Portland's Neighborhood Emergency Teams (NET), ran a test deployment at the 2011 Northwest Permaculture Convergence, and published a guide to emergency composting and waste management, the Sewer Catastrophe Companion.
5. Toured every DEQ office and metro area of more than 10,000 in Oregon to evangelize composting toilets and greywater systems.
6. Gave trainings on greywater at Oregon Onsite Wastewater Association.

We went separate ways in early 2014, but the work continued.
Molly became Recode's director from 2014-16, continuing to promote innovative water and sanitation systems in Oregon. Her TED talk has nearly 2 million views. Molly is now an architect at [PIVOT](https://pivotarchitecture.com/people/).

As a result of our DEQ office tour and the Reach Code work, I ended up chairing a committee to write a new chapter for the Uniform Plumbing Code on Composting and Urine Diverting Toilets that was incorporated into the 2017 WE Stand Supplement (an ANSI Standard). I've followed this code reform through to today, as integration in the main UPC. 

I've continued to stay active in sanitation design, consulting for Hipcamp on their sanitation policy and redesigning the urine diverter for SOIL.
