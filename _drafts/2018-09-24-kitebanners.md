intro: 
 - excerpt: "Kites are the earliest form of flight, and still one of the cheapest and most dependable. One day they will pull airships.

 

 My interest is kite construction for workshop production. I like making kites that tape together quickly out of bamboo, paper, tyvek, plastic bags, emergency blankets and other common, inexpensive materials. I indulge my passion for research digging through kitesâ€™ long history. I collect books on historical and contemporary kites, seek out kite makers, and adapt kite designs for workshop construction."

# Kite banners

Over the past year I've been making kite banners.

## Flag tails

A a long flag tail for my first attempt. A shorter tail would work. I tried stiffening it with sticks and straws, which made flight behavior worse on the kite.

## Line Flags

Then I moved to strong paper and wooden dowels. because they're cheap, quick, and biodegradable. Slogan banners should match the disposability of slogans.

I sumi calligraphy paper. Shinjo/Sumi-E/Washi can be found at 0.75oz/yard, the same weight as good ripstop nylon. A 140" x 30" paper banner uses $12.00 of paper, ripstop would cost ~$40.00.

Jayne Meacham and I glued a frame into it and came up with the slogan "WHICH WAR?"

## Assembly

#### 1
Cut 4' off the end of the roll, and cut it in half.

Cut the roll of paper in half and glue a frame of jute or hemp cord along the paper's edges. to make a 30" x 140" poster. The frame is a 2.5" of paper folded over the 15lb jute chord, with PVA (Elmers) glue spackled on.

The chord needs to be stretched while being glued. Otherwise it will stretch in flight and rip the paper.  


We glued strips of paper about 2" wide down to the 1/8" dowels to re-enforce the paper.


Books help hold the chord in place during gluing. I put on a light coating of glue with a spatula. . 




I used some of watered down poster paint and a 2" brush to letter the sign.


The rectangular stick frame warped and ripped the paper after about 45 minutes of flight. 



I repaired the banner with tyvek end pieces. It tore again along a previous break. The tyvek is stiffer than the paper, which i think contributed to the break.


Take 3 (actual instructions)

nim wunnan for the paint
jack lewis for the brush
Dan kurahashi gave me a spatula.
