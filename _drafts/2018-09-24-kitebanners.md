# Kite banners

Over the past year I've been making kite banners.

## Flag tails

A a long flag tail for my first attempt. A shorter tail would work. I tried stiffening it with sticks and straws, which made flight behavior worse on the kite.

## Line Flags

Then I moved to shinjo paper and wooden dowels (shinjo is machine-made washi). becuase they're cheap and biodegradable.


Jayne Meacham and I glued a frame into it and came up with the slogan "which war?"

We cut the roll of paper in half and glued it together to make a 30" x 140" poster. The frame is a 2.5" of paper folded over the 15lb jute chord, with PVA (Elmers) glue spackled on.

The chord needs to be stretched while being glued. Otherwise it will stretch in flight and rip the paper.  


We glued strips of paper about 2" wide down to the 1/8" dowels to re-enforce the paper.


Books help hold the chord in place during gluing. I put on a light coating of glue with a spatula. . 




I used some of watered down poster paint and a 2" brush to letter the sign.


The rectangular stick frame warped and ripped the paper after about 45 minutes of flight. 



I repaired the banner with tyvek end pieces. It tore again along a previous break. The tyvek is stiffer than the paper, which i think contributed to the break.
