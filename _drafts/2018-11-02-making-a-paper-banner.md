## Making a paper banner


#### materials

* Elmer's glue or other PVA glue
* one 18" x 30' roll of mulberry paper, such as:
 * [Aitoh's Shuji Gami Sumi-E calligraphy paper](https://www.misterart.com/paper-boards/writing-printer-paper/calligraphy-paper/aitoh-washi-paper-rolls.html)
 * Washi, Shoji or another mulburry paper (kozo)
* five 36" x 1/8" diameter birch dowels
* two 36" x 1/4" diameter birch dowels
* 50' of jute string 15lb or stronger or another coarse fiber string
* one large 3" carabiner and 5 small carabiners
* kids tempera paints
* 3" paint brush
* paper tape or masking tape 
* cardboard scraps for spreading glue
* newspaper to protect surfaces
* books/heavy things to hold the chord taut



#### tools

 * measuring tape
 * ruler/straight edge
 * hole punch 

the stiffer 1/4" dowels will be used at either side for strength. THe middle dowels can all be 1/8" diameter. 

Additional 1/8" dowels are needed to prevent flapping, but 


Cut 4' off the end of the roll, cut this piece into nine  3" x 4' strips. These strips will be used to hold the banner together.

Cut the remaining paper in half, and join down the middle with the 3" strips.

One at a time, spread a thin layer of glue onto the paper strips and glue them down the middle of the banner. While strong when dry, the paper become progressively soggy and fragile as the glue soaks in.

Place the paper strip quickly. Don't fidget with with the paper once placed. A few wrinkles are fine, straightening them out is dangerous.

Cut triangles out of both sides of the sign.

Stretch the jute string along the top edge of the paper 1-2" from the edge, Crease the paper along the string.  I marked the fold with pencil, but the stretched string is sufficient to hold a straight line.

Tie four loops off along the top of the string.

![sign loop diagram ](../assets/images/banner/bannerdiagram1.jpg)

Use the assistance of a friend or books or other heavy objects to hold the string taut.  Pre-stretching the string before gluing is important to prevent the string from stretching in flight and ripping the paper.

![sign loop diagram ](../assets/images/banner/P2370438.jpg)

After protecting the paper with a small piece of masking tape, use a hole punch to make holes at the location of the loops. Pull the loop through.

working a few feet at a time, apply a layer of glue inside the crease and fold the paper over.

Wait at least 20 minutes for the paper to dry and regain strength before gluing the sides. 

Fold the paper around the string and 

We glued strips of paper about down to the 1/8" dowels to re-enforce the paper.


Books help hold the chord in place during gluing. I put on a light coating of glue with a piece of cardboard or other tool, such as this wedge of plastic.




I used some of watered down poster paint and a 2" brush to letter the sign.





The rectangular stick frame warped and ripped the paper after about 45 minutes of flight. 



I repaired the banner with tyvek end pieces. It tore again along a previous break. The tyvek is stiffer than the paper, which i think contributed to the break.


Take 3 (actual instructions)


Jayne Meacham and I glued a frame into it and came up with the slogan "WHICH WAR?" because we don't know what war the USS Portland is headed to.

nim wunnan for the paint
jack lewis for the brush
Dan kurahashi gave me a spatula.



## Early takes: Flag tails & line flags


I made a long flag tail for my first attempt. A shorter tail would work. I tried stiffening it with sticks and straws, which made flight behavior worse on the kite.

The polyethylene sheeting I used didn't permanently accept any sort of ink I know of. Permanent sharpie paint markers lasted for a while, but would turn to powder and fall off. 

## Thanks

Much thanks to my friends who helped me put this together. Jack Lewis for space and paint brushes, Nim Wunnan for recommending and loaning tempera paint, and Jayne Meacham for assistance in assembling the first sign.
