intro: 
 - excerpt: "Kites are the earliest form of flight, and still one of the cheapest and most dependable. One day they will pull airships.

 

 My interest is kite construction for workshop production. I like making kites that tape together quickly out of bamboo, paper, tyvek, plastic bags, emergency blankets and other common, inexpensive materials. Kites’ long history indulges my passion for research. I collect books on historical and contemporary kites, seek out kite makers, and adapt kite designs for workshop construction."
