v3.0 *Draft*

## Introduction 

*Time: about one hour*

The Boundary Layers walk is an outdoor education activity introducing atmospheric turbulence stratification. The goal is to build awareness of wind's movements through the local environment and plants' observable responses to wind force.

*[Mathew Lippincott](http://mathewlippincott.com) developed the original exercise through a [Guerilla Science](http://guerillascience.org) residency at [Pratt](Pratt.edu). This version of the exercise was revised and illustrated with assistance of the [AREN Project.](https://www.globe.gov/web/aren-project/overview/aerokats)*

## Materials

* Ribbon wands
* Handouts on the Beaufort Wind Force Scale
* Mossy logs/rocks (one per 5 attendees)
 * Magnifying glasses or hand lenses for each log or rock
 * *Please put mosses back after your workshop*

## Overview
These lessons are written as a script. Instructor text is in plain text. *Instructor actions are in italics*

## Boundary Layers Walk

Today we're going to explore how trees reshape the atmosphere and observe the signs of the wind moving around us.

A boundary layer is the space between an object and the free flow of air where air speed increases from zero at the surface of the object up to the speed of the unencumbered stream of air.

  There’s a boundary layer between this tent and the outside, and between you and the moss you’re looking at.

*Distribute hand lenses and moss*

Moss is a tiny forest.  Each tendril is its own plant, and all the tendrils work together to hold in moisture. If you look hard carefully, a whole world of microscopic creatures lives in that forest. Life can thrive in the moss because moss has slowed the air down and captured water in a protected boundary layer of air.

Moss's rough surface creates a turbulent Boundary Layer. As air swirls and mixes over rough surface of the moss, it separates from the flow and slows down more quickly. Boundary layers to make pleasant, safe zones to grow. From mosses to grasses and trees, plant communities make their own protective boundary layers.

Trees create the thickest boundary layer, lifting the wind above the surface of earth to create a big pocket of still air that retains moisture. Trees can make their own weather by working in together in forests.

## Visualizing wind in boundary layer with ribbons

A lightweight ribbon will become caught in an air current, allowing us to see the wind moving around obstacles. 

*Hand out ribbon wands*



When we use a ribbon to visualize the wind, we can call it an *anemoscope*, from the Greek for *wind seeing*. Scientific instruments don't have to be complicated. Sometimes they can just be ribbon wands. 

*Other Anemoscopes:*

* *weathervane*
* *windsock*
* *bubbles*



*Allow open exploration, encourage groups to stand in different positions down wind from trees and large obstacles.*

What are the effects of buildings and other large obstacles? 

*Split into groups of 4-8 to explore wind moving around trees and other large obstacles such as buildings.*

![buildiings and ribbon wands](../assets/images/boundarylayers/building.png)

*Bring the group together to discuss findings.* 

## The Boundary Layer in Grasses


*This excercise takes place in medium grasses or near bushes. Transitioning from laying down to standing, participants will move through the grass's boundary layer.*

* *Form a circle*

The wind is exponentially stronger at the top of a plant community than at the base.  The best way to experience the transition in wind force from a full speed stream to the still air at the ground is to move through a plant's boundary layer.

*Encourage participants to engage to their comfort level. It is ok to leave your eyes open or not want to lay down*

*Take an appropriate pause at each of these levels with eyes closed.* 

* *lay down*
* *sit up*
* *stand*

Pay attention to the sounds of the wind, changes in temperature, the feeling of wind on your skin and especially on your face.


 
## Trees Effects on the Boundary Layer

Now that we have a sense for what a boundary layer feels like, lets explore how plants make one.


I’m going to be a lone conifer tree in a field, an evergreen that has needles.

![me as a tree](../assets/images/boundarylayers/treeinthewind.png)


## Being a conifer tree

### Resonating like a tree


Musical instruments are made from wood because it resonates. Wood holds a note. Vortices tumbling branches resonate at a sustained frequency. We love wood for resonating, but resonating is a problem for a tree. Trees want to shed the wind's force quickly so they can be ready to absorb the next gust. 

The movement of a trees' many branches help them absorb the wind because each branch resonates at a different frequency, and their clashing rhythms dampen motion. by all resonating at different, interfering frequencies.

*Encourage everyone to put their hands out and be trees*

The branches on a tree work together to dampen movement for the tree. The branches are swaying each at a slightly different pace, and those clashing rhythms cancel each other out.


1. *Wave one arm up and down at about once per second. Move vigorously, then pause.*

2. *Wave the other arm up and down at about three times per second.*

3. *Attempt to wave both arms at the two different speeds.*


### How trees shape the wind

As the air moves around me, it sticks to my rough surface and starts to spin. 

As the air spins it expands to fill the space behind me and detaches from the my leaves, creating a tree-sized spinning air bubble, or air mass. pullng at the air around it, this air mass becomes a vortex.  These continue about 8-10 tree heights behind a tree, and extend about 2.5 tree heights above a tree. 



![vortex behind a tree, an overhead view](../assets/images/boundarylayers/treeoverhead.png)



Flags flap because vortex streets form behind a flagpoles.  Vorticies peels off alternating sides of the pole, inducing the wave seen in a flag.

### Practicing the Beafort wind force scale for conifers


*Practice three levels first*

![handout conifer beaufort](../assets/images/boundarylayers/coniferarm.png)

A **light breeze** is a Force 2 wind, the kind you can just barely feel on your cheek. My twigs and needles are going to begin waving. (4-7mph, Force 2)


A **moderate breeze** is a Force 4 wind where dried leaves and dust get kicked up (13-18mph) My small branches are in constant motion, and I’m starting to sway at the top.

In a Force 6 **strong breeze** (25-31mph) my trunk is swaying and my large branches are in constant motion. 

As a Force 8 **gale** (32-45mph) picks up, my whole trunk is in constant motion and the clashing of my branches breaks needles and twigs. 

In gale and storm force winds and I’m fighting for survival. If the wind hits 60mph I am hit by 200 tons of force. I’m dissipating that energy by moving and straining everything I’ve got, from my roots up to my needles. Movement can dissipate about a 1/3 of the wind's force.


*Break into teams and try out being trees at different wind force levels.*


Just as branches swaying at different frequencies dissipate energy, tree trunks swaying at different frequencies in a forest dampen each others' swaying as they bump into each other. These collisions diffuse about a 1/3 of the wind’s energy. We can expect solitary trees to move about 1/3 more than trees in a stand. 

*Spread out to be trees again.*

 
## Being a Deciduous Tree

Now we're going to be deciduous trees. Trees with broad leaves that drop in winter.

*Hold your arms up like a field goal*

Deciduous trees have branching trunks that go up and run into each other like a forest of conifers. Deciduous trees are somewhat better at dissipating the winds energy than conifers.

*Hand out deciduous tree cards*

![handout conifer beaufort](../assets/images/boundarylayers/deciduousme.png)


*Practice three levels of the Beaufort scale together*

In a Force 2 **light breeze** (4-7mph)

 * Leaves rustle

In a Force 4 **moderate breeze** (13-18mph)

 * small branches move
 * small leaves turn over

 In a Force 6 **strong breeze** (25-31mph)
 
 * large branches in motion
 * large leaves turned over

## Systematic ribbon wand deployment

*Return to the ribbon wands and spread out across a field at even intervals behind a tree* 

![vortex behind a tree, an overhead view](../assets/images/boundarylayers/ribbongrid.png)



*Observe differences in wind effects and share observations*

*Throw ribbon wands in the air and celebrate!*
