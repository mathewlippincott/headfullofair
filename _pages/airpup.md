intro: 
 - excerpt: "[Airpup](/tags/airpup) is a small [kite balloon](/tags/kite-balloons) designed to provide a steady aerial platform in winds from 0-20mph. Lightweight construction and a novel kite shape allow Airpup to use 40% less helium than spherical balloons while also flying in much higher winds, and a rail-mount system makes payload management simple.

 
A [Crowd Supply campaign](https://www.crowdsupply.com/head-full-of-air/airpup) for Airpup gives a good overview of capabilities and led to a small production run. Because demand has been limited, Airpup is currently only available as a [custom order](/contact) for projects that support ongoing development. 


[Airpup is open hardware](/post/airpup-production-plans). Collaborators and replication are invited. *More [blog posts about Airpup](/tags/airpup).*"
