intro: 
 - excerpt: "I've flown a lot of different kites, reels, and camera rigs. My favorite aerial photography setup right now is my Stormy Sled kite, line-counting fishing reel with 30lb kevlar line, the KAPtery Jerk Pan camera rig, and either a small Mobius action cam or a Canon S100 with CHDK, depending on the wind."
